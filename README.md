## Overview

This repository contains information and code for building a German Language Model using the [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) library and applying it on a variety of NLP tasks such as text classification.

The backbone of the model is trained on the German Wikipedia Corpus and heavily inspired by the [Universal Language Model Fine-tuning for Text Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06146) paper from Jeremy Howard and Sebastian Ruder.

## TODO
- fine-tune and evaluate classifier using [SB-10k: German Sentiment Corpus](https://www.spinningbytes.com/resources/germansentiment/)

## Future research
to be updated
